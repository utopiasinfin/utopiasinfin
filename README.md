Hi, I’m @utopiasinfin — my name is Wilson Escobar Rodríguez, based in Berlin, Germany.

I’m currently doing a vocational retraining program (Umschulung) to become an **IT Specialist in System Integration (Fachinformatiker für Systemintegration, IHK track)**. My goal is to grow step by step into real-world IT work: supporting users, administering systems, and building reliable network infrastructures.

## What I’m focusing on (and practicing a lot)
- **Networking fundamentals:** IPv4 subnetting, VLANs, routing/switching basics, DHCP, DNS, firewalls/NAT
- **System administration:** Linux (Debian/Fedora) and Windows environments (Windows Server / AD fundamentals)
- **Virtualization & labs:** QEMU/KVM, VirtualBox; learning the concepts behind enterprise virtualization
- **IT support & troubleshooting:** structured problem analysis, documentation, and clean handovers
- **Programming basics:** Java (structured + OOP) for learning logic and automation thinking
- **Documentation:** project-based learning and Berichtsheft (clear, reproducible steps)

## My hands-on setup (home lab)
I’m a daily Linux user and run a multi-boot setup (**Debian 12,Debian 13, Manjaro, Ubuntu and the magnificient Fedora**).  
I also maintain a **Debian 12 headless server on an older laptop** for practicing real admin tasks (SSH, Samba, basic services, networking labs, etc.).  
I learn best by building, breaking, and documenting.
The best feeling is to be running manjaro with I3 window manager in a Macbook Pro from the 2013, and works flawless!!!

## Interests
- Linux systems & server administration
- Networking (especially “how things really work” in practice)
- Virtual machines & lab environments
- Sustainable tech projects (e.g., **Aguavida**: environmental monitoring + self-hosted infrastructure)
- Long-term: security-minded system integration (clean configs, least privilege, good documentation)

## Collaboration
I’m happy to collaborate on beginner-friendly or practice-oriented projects around:
- network labs / tooling
- Linux administration scripts (small automation)
- documentation-driven projects (step-by-step guides)
- homelab / self-hosting setups

## Languages
Spanish (native), German, English, Italian
